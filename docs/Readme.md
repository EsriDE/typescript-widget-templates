# Camera Status placed in raw HTML/JS demo

### Description
This little sample app shows how to add our basic CameraStatus widget to a sample app right from the official ArcGIS API for JavaScript documentation. The sample has been taken from here: https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/intro-sceneview/index.html. It has only been enhanced by a few lines of code necessary to require and instantiate the CameraStatus widget from a basic HTML/JS file.

This sample app is live under https://esride.github.io/typescript-widget-templates/.

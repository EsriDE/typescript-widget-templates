# Simple Template without settings 

## Description
The widget is a simple widget with an interactive settings page. 

## HowTo:
1. Start coding in your "Widget.ts" file
2. Create links to the Web AppBuilder stemapp (and to you app path):  

```
// You need to be admin to execute the following lines:
mklink /d <WAB Path>\client\stemapp\widgets\DerivedTemplate <Dev Path>\Widgets\DerivedTemplate 
mklink /d <WAB Path>\server\apps\<your app number>>\widgets\DerivedTemplate <Dev Path>\Widgets\DerivedTemplate 
```

## Golden rules:
- Use the ReadmeTemplate.md in this sample as a template for your Readme.md. Every widget should have a Readme.md!

## Compatibility
Created and tested for Web AppBuilder 2.4, 2.5, 2.6
